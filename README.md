## Simple issue tracker

This app is my personal programming project that helped me learn new technologies and demonstrate my skills as a developer.  

Its functionality includes adding, editing and deleting entries as well as categorizing and sorting them. Just try it yourself and get the first-hand experience - it is availible [here](https://issue-tracker-wm.herokuapp.com). 

### The list of technologies used for development includes:

Backend:  
- Node.JS
- Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Typescript

Frontend:  
- Vue CLI + Vue Router + Vuex
- Typescript
- Axios


Authorisation done through [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) 3rd-party service using JWT.  
The app is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) platform.
